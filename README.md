# Bookstore-Management-System-using-C-and-Data-Structures

Project Title: Bookstore Management System using C++ and DSA

Description:
This is a console-based C++ project that manages a bookstore's inventory using Data Structures. It allows users to add, search, display, delete, and purchase books. The book list is maintained using a linked list, and recent purchases are tracked using a stack. The system provides a menu-driven interface for performing operations like adding books, displaying all books, purchasing a book (which decreases quantity), viewing recent purchases, and deleting a book by ID. This project demonstrates the practical use of linked lists and stacks in inventory and purchase management.
